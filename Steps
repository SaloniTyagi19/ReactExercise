1) You need to install nodejs 
2) After that just run the command at the location where you want to create your project which is given below:
    npx create-react-app "projectName"
    Note: In my case I have given the name as StringManipulation
3) Now go the location and in the project using command line with "cd location"command
4) Now make the changes in the index file which I uploaded and then run the command npm start to start the running of the project over web.
